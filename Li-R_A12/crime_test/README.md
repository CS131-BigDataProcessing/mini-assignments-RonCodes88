# Crime Test

This package provides functions to validate the 'Vict Sex' and 'Vict Age' columns in crime data. It checks if the 'Vict Sex' values are either 'M' or 'F' and if the 'Vict Age' values are between 1-100. In addition, it calculates the mean and median of the 'Vict Age' column.

## Installation

To install the package, run:

pip install crime_test
